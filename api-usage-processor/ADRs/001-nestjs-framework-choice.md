# ADR 001: NestJS Framework Choice

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to choose a backend framework for the Team Guideline Pulse API that provides:
- TypeScript support
- Enterprise-grade architecture patterns
- Built-in security features
- Excellent documentation and community support
- Easy testing and validation
- Production-ready performance

## Decision

We chose **NestJS** as our backend framework.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **TypeScript First**: Native TypeScript support with excellent type inference
- **Enterprise Patterns**: Built-in dependency injection, decorators, and modular architecture
- **Security**: Built-in guards, interceptors, and middleware for security
- **Validation**: Seamless integration with class-validator and class-transformer
- **Testing**: Excellent testing utilities and mocking support
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and active community
- **Performance**: Built on Express.js with additional optimizations
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture that scales well

### Negative

- **Learning Curve**: Steeper learning curve for developers new to decorators and DI
- **Opinionated**: More opinionated than Express.js, less flexibility
- **Bundle Size**: Larger bundle size due to framework overhead
- **Dependencies**: More dependencies to manage

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Express.js + TypeScript**
   - Pros: Lightweight, flexible, familiar
   - Cons: Requires manual setup for patterns, more boilerplate

2. **Fastify**
   - Pros: High performance, TypeScript support
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem, less enterprise features

3. **Koa.js**
   - Pros: Modern middleware, lightweight
   - Cons: Less TypeScript support, smaller ecosystem

## Implementation

- Use NestJS CLI for project generation
- Implement modular architecture with feature modules
- Use built-in guards for rate limiting and security
- Leverage class-validator for request validation
- Implement comprehensive testing with Jest
