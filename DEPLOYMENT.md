# Deployment Suggestions

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**: This document contains deployment suggestions and examples only. These are provided as-is without any warranty or guarantee. We take NO RESPONSIBILITY for any issues, security vulnerabilities, data loss, or problems that may arise from following these suggestions. Always consult with qualified professionals and perform thorough testing before deploying to production environments.

This guide provides basic deployment suggestions for the Team Pulse API and Chrome Extension. Use at your own risk.

## API Deployment (Basic Suggestions)

### 1. Environment Setup

**Suggestion**: Create a production environment file:

```bash
# api-usage-processor/.env.production
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
DB_HOST=your-production-db-host
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your-db-user
DB_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
DB_NAME=your-db-name
APP_TIMEZONE=America/Sao_Paulo
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-domain.com,chrome-extension://*

# Security settings
RATE_LIMIT_TTL=60
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=60
BURST_TTL=5
BURST_MAX=10
MAX_EVALUATIONS_PER_REQ=200
JSON_BODY_LIMIT=64kb
API_SHARED_KEY=your-production-api-key
```

> **Note**: These are example values. Replace with your actual configuration.

### 2. Database Setup (Examples Only)

**Suggestion**: Use a managed PostgreSQL service or self-hosted database.

#### Example: Managed PostgreSQL
- AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or similar managed services
- Configure with appropriate security settings
- Set up proper backup and monitoring

#### Example: Self-Hosted PostgreSQL
```bash
# Basic installation example (adapt to your needs)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib

# Create database and user (example only)
sudo -u postgres psql
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
CREATE USER your_user WITH PASSWORD 'your-secure-password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE your_database_name TO your_user;
```

> **Warning**: These are basic examples. Consult PostgreSQL documentation and security best practices.

### 3. Application Deployment (Basic Examples)

**Suggestion**: Choose a deployment method that fits your infrastructure.

#### Example: Docker
```bash
# Build image (example)
docker build -t your-api:latest ./api-usage-processor

# Run container (example - adapt to your needs)
docker run -d \
  --name your-api \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  --env-file ./api-usage-processor/.env.production \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  your-api:latest
```

#### Example: PM2 Process Manager
```bash
# Install PM2 (example)
npm install -g pm2

# Build and start (example)
cd api-usage-processor
pnpm run build
pm2 start dist/main.js --name your-api
```

#### Example: Kubernetes
```yaml
# Basic Kubernetes example (adapt to your needs)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: your-api
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: your-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: your-api
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: your-api
        image: your-api:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
        # Add your environment variables and secrets
```

> **Note**: These are simplified examples. Consult Docker, PM2, or Kubernetes documentation for proper configuration.

### 4. Basic Security (Examples Only)

**Suggestion**: Set up HTTPS and basic security measures.

#### Example: Nginx Reverse Proxy
```nginx
# Basic Nginx example (adapt to your needs)
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    # Add your SSL certificates
    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

#### Example: SSL Certificate
- Use Let's Encrypt, your hosting provider's SSL, or purchase certificates
- Configure automatic renewal if possible

> **Warning**: These are basic examples. Consult Nginx and SSL documentation for proper security configuration.

## Chrome Extension Deployment (Basic Examples)

### 1. Build Extension

**Suggestion**: Build the extension for production:

```bash
cd user-interface
pnpm run build:prod
```

### 2. Distribution Options (Examples Only)

#### Option A: Chrome Web Store
1. Go to [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/)
2. Upload your built extension
3. Fill in required details (description, screenshots, privacy policy)
4. Submit for review

#### Option B: Private Distribution
1. Build extension with your settings
2. Distribute ZIP file to users
3. Users load unpacked in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/` → Developer mode → Load unpacked)

#### Option C: Enterprise Distribution
- Create enterprise policies for automatic installation
- Host update manifests for automatic updates

> **Note**: These are basic examples. Consult Chrome Web Store documentation for detailed requirements.

## Important Considerations (Examples Only)

### Security (Basic Examples)
- Use HTTPS in production
- Set up proper authentication and authorization
- Configure firewalls and network security
- Keep software updated
- Use strong passwords and API keys
- Implement proper backup strategies

### Monitoring (Basic Examples)
- Set up health checks for your API
- Monitor database connectivity
- Check application logs regularly
- Set up alerts for critical issues

### Maintenance (Basic Examples)
- Test updates in staging environment first
- Plan for database migrations
- Have rollback procedures ready
- Regular security updates
- Monitor resource usage
